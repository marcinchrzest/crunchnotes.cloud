## Crunch, a.k.a. Marcin

IT Consultant with nearly 20 years of experience across infrastructure, cloud and security. Day to day I work with Azure, M365 and PowerShell – designing, deploying and maintaining cloud environments for various clients and projects.

The nickname "Crunch" comes from my surname – Chrzęst is Polish for Crunch. It stuck.

## What this blog is about

CrunchNotes are my field notes from the cloud trenches – things I run into during everyday work with cloud platforms. Configurations, troubleshooting, scripts, lessons learned from deployments. I used to keep all of this in OneNote for myself, but figured it's better to put it in one place where I can easily come back to it and share with others.

This is not a step-by-step tutorial blog. Think short, practical posts – field notes that might help if you're dealing with a similar problem.

## Beyond work

Building a house, raising two kids, and trying not to skip the 5 AM gym session. Also working on a SaaS side project – [BridgeTenant.com](https://bridgetenant.com).
