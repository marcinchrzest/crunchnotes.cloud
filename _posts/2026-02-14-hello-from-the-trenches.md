This is CrunchNotes – my corner of the internet where I dump field notes from everyday cloud work.

I'm Marcin, a.k.a. Crunch (surname Chrzęst = Crunch in Polish). Nearly 20 years in IT, currently deep in Azure, M365 and PowerShell. For years I've been keeping notes in OneNote – configs that worked, scripts that saved the day, issues that took hours to figure out. Useful stuff, but buried where nobody (including future me) could easily find it.

So here we are. CrunchNotes is that pile of notes, cleaned up just enough to be readable. No polished tutorials, no "complete guide to X" posts. Just short, practical write-ups from real work – the kind of thing I wish I'd found when searching at 11 PM with a broken deployment.

What to expect: Azure infrastructure, M365 administration, PowerShell scripts, and whatever else I run into on the job. If it made me think "I should write this down" – it'll probably end up here.

Let's see where this goes.

*– Mr. Crunch*
